Arye is a Ph.D. candidate in Environmental Science and Management. He previously received a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science with a concentration in Earth Science from Tulane University. His work explores how coastal communities choose management strategies such as beach nourishment, groin construction, and landward retreat in relation to their neighboring communities. He also investigates how each community values its beach for recreational purposes, the physical efficiency of its beach nourishment project, and how these geophysical and economic components control their consequent nourishment decisions. Toward these goals, he has developed a coupled geomorphic-economic modeling framework to account for both human and natural dynamics and constructed a community-scale field dataset including beach nourishment frequency/magnitude and socioeconomic data. This research adds to our understanding of anthropogenically-modified systems and will help inform coastal managers and policymakers faced with the challenges associated with climate change such as sea-level rise and increased material costs in the future.


Arye previously served as a Research Intern in coastal microbiology with Drs. Ray Sambrotto and Kevin O’Driscoll funded by the Surfer’s Environmental Alliance, worked on projects in fluvial and coastal geomorphology with Dr. Nicole Gasparini of Tulane, was as a Natural Resource Intern with Dr. Julie Whitbeck at Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve, and worked as a laboratory/field technician with Dr. Norb Psuty for the Sandy Hook Cooperative Research Programs.


Arye is also an avid surfer, kayaker, bicyclist, runner, swimmer, and amateur photographer. He is the Secretary of the Bradley Beach Environmental Commission, volunteered on the Bradley Beach Oceanfront Development Task Force, and is a Special Advisor to the Bradley Beach Democratic District Delegates for the Monmouth County Democratic Committee.

Date: 07/21/2020

Arye Janoff was selected for the prestigious NOAA Sea Grant 2021 John A. Knauss Marine Policy Fellowship in Washington D.C. starting next February! He will be placed in the legislative branch of the federal government, working for either a personal office or Congressional Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives or the U.S. Senate. While his host office will not be determined until January 2021, his service in Congress will be to ensure that science informs the bi-partisan legislative process on issues related to coastal and marine resources. The Knauss Fellowship provides an excellent opportunity to continue developing his skillset of science implementation across various levels of government. We are proud and excited to see where his career path may lead!
